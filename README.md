Assisted reproduction super ovulation system

â€‹	Superovulation stimulation (COH) is one of the important aspects of ART. A reasonable, standardized and safe superovulation stimulation process is the prerequisite for obtaining high-quality and high-volume embryos, and it is also the basic guarantee for improving the clinical pregnancy rate. In the ART process, different patients have different conditions such as ovarian function. In order to achieve an effective ovulation induction effect, it is often necessary to formulate different ovulation induction programs according to the patient's condition. Such as long-term plan (long-acting long-term plan, short-acting long-term plan), short plan, ultra-short plan, antagonist plan, micro-stimulation plan, mild stimulation plan, natural cycle, etc. As there is currently no unified COH medication plan to guide clinicians in individualized and precise diagnosis and treatment, it leads to the control of medication dosage in clinical work, the interpretation of the results of promoting excretion, and the prediction of the outcome of long-term egg harvesting. Different clinicians have a larger clinical experience. difference. This project use NN or RNN to help doctors predict the exact number.
